                    <a>Following the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, who portrayed King T'Challa/Black Panther in the first film, "Wakanda Forever" is anticipated to explore how Wakanda and its people move forward in the wake of this loss. It's likely that the film will focus on other characters from the original film and expand the world of Wakanda further.

                        Details about the plot and specific storylines of "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" have been kept tightly under wraps by Marvel Studios, so fans eagerly await more information. The film is expected to pay tribute to Boseman's legacy while continuing to celebrate African culture and representation in superhero cinema.
